# Noise Analysis Project

## Project Description: Noise Analysis in Sensor Data Using Experimental Simulation


## Note on This Project
This project was created for learning purposes during my study of noise
and uncertainty analysis.The implementation closely follows guided examples and external references.
The code was used to understand the methodology rather than to present an
original contribution.This repository is intended as a learning and practice exercise.


The project uses this method to generate data similar to sensor measurements. A clean signal is produced, and sensor values ​​are simulated by adding noise to the signal. Graphical and statistical analysis and evaluation are also obtained using Python.

## Data Set / Data Source
Noise measurements taken from simulated sensors are used in this study.
The dataset consists of numerical values representing noise levels over time.

## Methods
The following steps are applied in the project:
- Data loading and examination
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Noise level analysis
- Visualization of noise patterns
- Basic statistical analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file
3. Run the cells step by step
