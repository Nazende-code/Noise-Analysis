# Noise Analysis Project

## Project Description: Noise Analysis in Sensor Data Using Experimental Simulation

In this project, noise variations are analyzed using simulated sensor measurements.
A clean signal is generated, and different types of noise are added to this signal.
The sensor measurement process is simulated, and the resulting noisy data are analyzed
both graphically and statistically using Python.

## Data Set / Data Source
Noise measurements taken from simulated sensors are used in this study.
The dataset consists of numerical values representing noise levels over time.

## Methods
The following steps are applied in the project:
- Data loading and examination
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Noise level analysis
- Visualization of noise patterns
- Basic statistical analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file
3. Run the cells step by step
